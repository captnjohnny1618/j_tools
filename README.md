# J_TOOLS

John's personal MATLAB toolbox and script library.

## Installation

Clone or download the repository into the directory of your choice (your MATLAB user directory is probably the best and easiest choice).  If you downloaded the .zip, unpack it now.

Open MATLAB and navigate into the "j_tools" directory. Run

    >> INSTALL
    
This will add the entire library to your MATLAB path.

If you want this to be persistent, you can run 

    >> savepath
    
Or add 
    
    >> run('/path/to/j_tools/INSTALL.m')
    
to your startup.m script.

## Licensing

I dunno.  Be good? Be better?  Spread the love?  If you use something, please credit me.  That or whatever the license file says.
